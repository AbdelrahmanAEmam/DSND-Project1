# DSND-Project1
This repo contains the submission of DSND first project (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Python 3.x)

## Getting Started
The code provided is to help identifying what else could affect the price of a house other than the common attributes
(like number of rooms, footage area of the house, ..etc.) with more less recognized yet effective attributes using the
powerful tool knows as DATA SCIENCE

## Prerequisites
You should have at least Python 3.x and some mathematical, statistical and visualization libraries in order to run this code in your local machine.
Here I used: 
- pip (for installing the required libraries)
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Installation
Let's start first with installing the required libraries using pip

<code>python -m pip install --user numpy seaborn matplotlib pandas</code>

## Running the tests
If all the libraries are installed correctly open terminal (ctrl + alt + t) or any Python editor of your choice
in case you used terminal type <code>python3</code> then type:

  <code>import numpy</code>
  
  <code>import seaborn</code>
  
  <code>import matplotlib.pyplot</code>
  
  <code>import pandas</code>

**Now you are ready to go and run the code on your local machine...**

- First, clone the repo using: <code>git clone https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAEmam/DSND-Project1.git</code>
- Second, go to the repo location <code>cd path/to/repo</code>
- Finally, open submission.ipynb (for best practice use [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)

## Summary
Using Data Science it's proven that (age of the houe, the distance to nearest MRT, number of convenience stores) 
and many other features have a big effect on house pricing.
